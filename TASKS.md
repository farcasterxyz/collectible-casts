# Collectible Casts - TDD Task Breakdown

Each task follows the TDD cycle: RED â†’ GREEN â†’ REFACTOR â†’ COMMIT

## Current Status: AUCTION CONTRACT COMPLETE âœ…

All core contracts have been implemented with 100% test coverage:
- âœ… CollectibleCast (ERC-1155 NFT)
- âœ… Metadata (URI management)  
- âœ… Minter (Authorization layer)
- âœ… TransferValidator (Transfer controls)
- âœ… Royalties (ERC-2981 5% royalty)
- âœ… Auction (Complete implementation with 56 tests)

The Auction contract features:
- EIP-712 signature validation with multiple backend authorizers
- Three clean functions: start(), bid(), settle()
- Random bytes32 nonces from backend
- Automatic USDC refunds on overbidding
- Anti-snipe auction extensions
- 90/10 creator/treasury payment split
- Cast metadata storage for provenance

## Guiding Principles
- **KISS** (Keep It Simple, Stupid) - Choose the simplest solution
- **YAGNI** (You Aren't Gonna Need It) - Don't add functionality until needed
- **100% Test Coverage** - Every line of production code must be tested (verified with `python3 script/check-coverage.py`)
- **Minimal Interfaces** - Start with empty interfaces, add functions only when tests require them
- **Fuzz Test Upgrade** - After each GREEN phase, evaluate if unit tests can be upgraded to fuzz tests

## Coverage Verification
Before each commit, run `python3 script/check-coverage.py` to ensure 100% coverage for all production contracts. This script will fail if any production contract has less than 100% coverage on any metric (lines, statements, branches, or functions).

## Architecture Notes

### Module Pattern
All contracts follow a consistent module pattern:
- Core contract (CollectibleCast) delegates to modules
- Modules can be updated by owner
- Clean separation of concerns

### Auction Design Decisions
- **Three-function approach**: start(), bid(), settle() for clarity and simplicity
- **Backend authorization**: Multiple authorizers supported via allowlist
- **Random nonces**: Backend provides bytes32 nonces to prevent replay attacks
- **State derivation**: Auction state calculated from data rather than stored explicitly
- **Cast metadata**: Stored on auction start for provenance

### Security Considerations
- One-way switches prevent accidental disabling
- Allowlists provide granular control
- Custom errors for gas efficiency
- Comprehensive test coverage (100% on all production contracts)
- EIP-712 signatures prevent cross-chain replay attacks
- Automatic refunds reduce user friction

### Gas Optimizations
- Struct packing in TokenData and AuctionData
- Immutable variables where possible
- Efficient storage layout
- Minimal external calls
- Single SSTORE for auction creation
