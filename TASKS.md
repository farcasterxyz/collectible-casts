# Collectible Casts - TDD Task Breakdown

Each task follows the TDD cycle: RED â†’ GREEN â†’ REFACTOR â†’ COMMIT

## Guiding Principles
- **KISS** (Keep It Simple, Stupid) - Choose the simplest solution
- **YAGNI** (You Aren't Gonna Need It) - Don't add functionality until needed
- **100% Test Coverage** - Every line of production code must be tested (verified with `python3 script/check-coverage.py`)
- **Minimal Interfaces** - Start with empty interfaces, add functions only when tests require them
- **Fuzz Test Upgrade** - After each GREEN phase, evaluate if unit tests can be upgraded to fuzz tests

## Coverage Verification
Before each commit, run `python3 script/check-coverage.py` to ensure 100% coverage for all production contracts. This script will fail if any production contract has less than 100% coverage on any metric (lines, statements, branches, or functions).

## Completed Phases

### Phase 1: Contract Interfaces and Test Infrastructure âœ…
- Created minimal interfaces for all contracts
- Set up test infrastructure with forge-std patterns
- Removed unnecessary template files

### Phase 2: CollectibleCast Token âœ…
- Implemented ERC-1155 token with OpenZeppelin v5
- Added minter authorization with allowlist
- Enforced max supply of 1 per cast
- Implemented module management with setModule pattern
- Added transfer validation hooks
- Implemented EIP-2981 royalties (5% to creator)
- Achieved 100% test coverage

### Phase 3: Metadata Contract âœ…
- Implemented URI functions for contract and token metadata
- Added owner-controlled base URI management
- Achieved 100% test coverage

### Phase 4: Minter Contract âœ…
- Implemented authorization with allowlist pattern
- Added mint delegation to CollectibleCast
- Achieved 100% test coverage

### Phase 5: TransferValidator Contract âœ…
- Implemented one-way transfersEnabled switch
- Added operator allowlist for marketplace curation
- Correctly implemented two orthogonal concepts:
  - transfersEnabled: controls if ANY transfers are allowed
  - allowedOperators: controls third-party operators when transfers ARE enabled
- Achieved 100% test coverage

3. **Minter**: Authorization layer with allowlist
4. **TransferValidator**: Transfer control with one-way switch and operator allowlist
5. **Royalties**: Simple 5% royalty to creator

### Next Steps ðŸš€
1. **Auction Contract**: The main user-facing contract for bidding and settlement
   - Signature validation for backend authorization
   - USDC escrow and refund mechanism
   - Anti-snipe auction extensions
   - Settlement with payment splits

## Architecture Notes

### Module Pattern
All contracts follow a consistent module pattern:
- Core contract (CollectibleCast) delegates to modules
- Modules can be updated by owner
- Clean separation of concerns

### Security Considerations
- One-way switches prevent accidental disabling
- Allowlists provide granular control
- Custom errors for gas efficiency
- Comprehensive test coverage

### Gas Optimizations
- Struct packing in TokenData
- Immutable variables where possible
- Efficient storage layout
- Minimal external calls
