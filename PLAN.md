# Collectible Casts Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation approach for the Collectible Casts system. We've built a minimal, auditable contract suite following test-driven development principles.

## Current Architecture

```
┌─────────────────┐
│ CollectibleCast │ (Core ERC-721 NFT token)
└────────┬────────┘
         │ 
         └─── No external modules (simplified design)

┌─────────────┐
│   Auction   │ (Auction logic - mints tokens via CollectibleCast)
└─────────────┘
```

## Completed Implementation

### Phase 1: Core Token Contract (CollectibleCast) ✅
**What we built:**
- ERC-721 NFT contract (converted from ERC-1155)
- Uses cast hash (bytes32) as token ID
- Stores creator FID and address for each token
- Implements ERC-2981 royalty standard (5% to creator)
- Minter allowlist for access control
- Flexible metadata system with per-token URIs

**Key features implemented:**
- Token name: "CollectibleCast", symbol: "CAST"
- Batch metadata updates for backfilling
- Contract-level metadata support
- `exists()` function to check if token is minted
- 100% test coverage with 53 tests

### Phase 2: Auction Contract ✅
**What we built:**
- Clean three-function interface: `start()`, `bid()`, `settle()`
- EIP-712 signature validation for backend authorization
- USDC-only payments (hardcoded for simplicity)
- Automatic refunds when outbid
- Anti-snipe extensions (15 minutes)
- 90/10 creator/treasury split

**Key features implemented:**
- Multiple backend signers supported
- Random bytes32 nonces prevent replay attacks
- Bidder FID tracking for Farcaster integration
- USDC permit support for gasless approvals
- Self-bidding prevention
- 100% test coverage with 73 tests

### Phase 3: Deployment Infrastructure ✅
**What we built:**
- Production-ready deployment script
- Uses ImmutableCreate2 for deterministic addresses
- Follows Farcaster deployment patterns
- Configured for Base mainnet USDC

## Design Decisions & History

### Major Refactoring: ERC-1155 → ERC-721
We converted from ERC-1155 to ERC-721 because:
- Each cast is unique (non-fungible)
- Simpler mental model and implementation
- Better marketplace compatibility
- No need for batch transfers or amounts

### Removed Components
We simplified the architecture by removing:
- **Metadata module**: Integrated directly into CollectibleCast
- **Minter module**: Integrated directly into CollectibleCast
- **TransferValidator module**: Removed entirely (unrestricted transfers)
- **Royalties module**: Integrated directly into CollectibleCast

This consolidation resulted in:
- Fewer contracts to deploy and manage
- Reduced gas costs
- Simpler upgrade paths
- Easier to audit and understand

### Module System
While we kept the `setModule()` function for future extensibility, it currently always reverts with `InvalidModule()`. This preserves the upgrade path without adding complexity.

## Testing Strategy

We followed strict TDD principles:
1. **RED**: Write failing test first
2. **GREEN**: Implement minimal code to pass
3. **REFACTOR**: Improve while keeping tests green
4. **COMMIT**: Only commit with all tests passing

Results:
- 128 total tests
- 100% coverage on both production contracts
- Extensive fuzz testing (10,000+ runs per test in CI)
- Edge cases thoroughly covered

## Security Considerations

1. **Simplicity**: Minimal attack surface through simple design
2. **Immutability**: Contracts are non-upgradeable
3. **Access Control**: Owner functions clearly separated
4. **Signature Security**: Proper EIP-712 implementation
5. **No Reentrancy**: Checks-effects-interactions pattern
6. **USDC Integration**: Direct transfers (no blacklist handling)

## Configuration & Deployment

### Immutable Configuration
- **Auction Contract**:
  - CollectibleCast address
  - USDC address (Base mainnet)
  - Treasury address
- **CollectibleCast Contract**:
  - Owner address
  - Base metadata URI

### Configurable Parameters
- **Per Auction** (via backend signature):
  - Minimum bid amount
  - Bid increment percentage  
  - Duration (typically 24 hours)
  - Extension settings
  - Protocol fee percentage

### Backend Signers
- Multiple signers supported via allowlist
- Can be added/removed by owner
- Sign auction parameters and bid authorizations

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Transfer restrictions**: Could re-add validator module if needed
2. **Metadata upgrades**: Module system allows future metadata providers
3. **Alternative payment tokens**: Could add ERC-20 support
4. **Batch operations**: Could add batch settling
5. **USDC blacklist handling**: Could add pull-pattern refunds

### Upgrade Path
The module system (`setModule()`) provides a clean upgrade path:
```solidity
// Currently always reverts
function setModule(bytes32, address) external onlyOwner {
    revert InvalidModule();
}
```

This can be extended to support new modules without changing core logic.

## Summary

We've successfully built a minimal, secure, and extensible Collectible Casts system:
- ✅ ERC-721 NFT with royalties
- ✅ Auction system with backend authorization
- ✅ 100% test coverage
- ✅ Production-ready deployment scripts
- ✅ Clean, auditable codebase
- ✅ Future extensibility via module system

The system is ready for deployment to Base mainnet.
